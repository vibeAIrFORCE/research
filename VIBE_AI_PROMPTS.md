If the token has less than $5M market cap, focus on micro-cap analysis.
If the token has governance features, include DAO analysis.
If Twitter sentiment is negative, investigate recent events.
```

Combine different data sources and outputs:
```
Use Twitter data provider AND web search AND documentation review to create both a written analysis AND a visual chart of key metrics.
```
