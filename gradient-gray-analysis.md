## üîç PROJECT FUNDAMENTALS

### Technology & Utility

Gradient offers a revolutionary solution to one of DeFi's biggest problems: price impact and slippage. The project has developed a proprietary technology called **CORE (Coordinated Order Routing Engine)** that consists of three execution layers:

1. **Flash Layer**: Provides instant, off-market trades leveraging native market maker liquidity
2. **Matching Layer**: Directly pairs counterparties for zero-slippage execution
3. **AMM Fallback**: Only routes to AMMs if no match exists in the other layers

This system allows users to trade without the price impact that typically occurs on traditional DEXs, potentially saving traders significant amounts on larger trades.

### Tokenomics
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Total Supply** | 10,000,000 GRAY |
| **Circulating Supply** | 10,592,387 GRAY (106% of total) |
| **Token Utility** | Powers the Gradient ecosystem and incentivizes liquidity providers |
| **Distribution** | Well-distributed with no excessive team holdings |

### Team & Development
- ‚úÖ GitHub repository is public, showing transparency
- ‚úÖ Audit completed by AssureDeFi
- ‚úÖ Active development with on-chain orderbook already live
